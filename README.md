*DESCRIPTION*: In this task, I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow, a powerful deep learning framework. The goal was to train a model to classify images into predefined categories, using a dataset of labeled images. The task required several stages, including data preprocessing, model architecture design, training the model, and evaluating its performance. The dataset I used contained images from various classes, and the goal was to identify the class of each image based on its visual features. The first step involved loading and preprocessing the image data. Images in their raw form are often too large and unstructured to be fed directly into a neural network, so they must first be resized to a consistent shape. I performed image resizing and normalization by scaling the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1. This step helps in faster convergence during training. Additionally, I applied data augmentation techniques, such as random rotations, flips, and zooms, to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and help the model generalize better by introducing slight variations in the images. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance and avoid overfitting. Next, I designed the architecture of the CNN using TensorFlow/Keras. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images using convolutional layers. I started by defining several convolutional layers that apply various filters to the input images. These layers help the network automatically learn important features such as edges, textures, and patterns that are crucial for classification. After each convolutional layer, I added max-pooling layers to reduce the spatial dimensions of the image while retaining essential information. This pooling operation helps in reducing the computational complexity of the model and makes it more efficient. The next key component was the fully connected (dense) layers at the end of the network, which serve as classifiers based on the features extracted by the convolutional layers. The final layer used a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class, with the highest probability indicating the predicted class for a given image. I also included dropout layers during training to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to zero during each update cycle. Once the model architecture was defined, I compiled the model with an appropriate optimizer (such as Adam) and a loss function (categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification). The optimizer helps minimize the loss function by updating the weights of the network through backpropagation. The model was trained on the training dataset for a specified number of epochs, with each epoch representing one full pass through the training data. The validation set was used to monitor the model’s performance during training and adjust hyperparameters if necessary. After training the model, I evaluated its performance on the test dataset. The evaluation metrics included accuracy, which measures how often the model correctly classified the images, as well as confusion matrix and classification report, which provided insights into the model’s performance across different classes, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. To further analyze the results, I plotted learning curves for both training and validation accuracy and loss, which helped visualize how the model was improving during training and if there was any overfitting.In conclusion, this task involved designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow. The network was able to automatically learn and extract important features from the images, making it highly effective for classification tasks. By utilizing preprocessing techniques, convolutional layers, and careful model evaluation, I was able to build a robust CNN that could accurately classify images into their respective categories. This task helped me deepen my understanding of deep learning techniques, CNNs, and image classification workflows using TensorFlow.
